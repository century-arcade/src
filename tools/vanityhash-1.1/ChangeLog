vanityhash 1.1 (2010-12-11)
  * vanityhash 1.0 mistakenly referred to itself as version 0.2.  
    Fixed.
  * Fixed POSIX::SIGINT() calls for compatibility with older versions 
    of Perl.
  * Added CRC digest support, though Digest::CRC's clone() support 
    seems to be broken.
  * README: Updated requirements text.
  * Added "sha1alt" digest type, for using Digest::SHA1 instead of 
    Digest::SHA.
  * Makefile: Added additional checks in test target.
