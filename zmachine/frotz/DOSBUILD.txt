===========================================================================

Frotz was originally written specifically for MS/PC DOS.  When it began 
to be ported to other machines and operating systems, the DOS port 
lagged behind.  This has been fixed to the extent that DOS is capable of 
the new enhancements.  For instance, DOS Frotz is now capable of using 
Blorb files to get audio and graphical data.  The old Infocom-style 
mechanism of doing this has been removed.  Sound is supported through 
Soundblaster compatible sound cards.  Graphic levels from Hercules to 
MCGA are supported.

To compile DOS Frotz, you need the following:
	* Borland Turbo C++ 3.00.  This is the latest version I'm aware 
	  of capable of building 16-bit DOS applications.
	* PC-DOS, MS-DOS, or DR-DOS version 5.0 or higher.
	  FreeDOS works well too.

==============
Compilation ||
==============

Turbo C++ is typically installed to C:\tc.  Make sure your path contains 
C:\tc\bin.  When this is done, type "make".  Did Borland's make program 
run?  Now type "tcc".  If those two commands work, then you should be 
ready to compile.

Somehow get the source tree onto your DOS machine or into a DOS 
emulation environment.  If you're using emulation, this should be as 
simple as copying the tree you're in now into the proper directory.  For 
real hardware, a floppy disk will do.

To compile, go into the Frotz directory and type "build".  That will 
invoke "build.bat", a batch file that simply executes "make -f 
makefile.tc".  The reason for this is a bit of syntactic sugar to deal 
with the fact that it is impractical to have one Makefile build both 
Unix and DOS versions.  After about a minute, you should have FROTZ.EXE.  
This file is all you need to run Frotz.  Put it somewhere in your path 
and go to wherever you keep your Infocom games.  Type "frotz zork1.dat" 
or whatever and there you go.

The exact hardware requirements of DOS Frotz are yet to be determined.  
Please send me reports of what Zcode works and what doesn't.
